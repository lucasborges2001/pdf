# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is maintained on a best-effort basis. Security fixes are provided for the latest commit on the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Send a private report with:
   - a clear description of the impact
   - steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
   - affected versions/commit
   - any suggested fix

Contact: **security@your-domain.example** (replace with a real address).

We aim to respond within a reasonable time and will coordinate disclosure once a fix is available.
